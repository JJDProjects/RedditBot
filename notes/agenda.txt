So far: we are able to print the first 15 comments of the top post in r/all

What to do:

1. Determine if a comment contains a wikipedia link. For testing, we can just print True whenever we find a wikipedia link

2. Look through replies of each of the 15 comments. Look through the first 5 replies (second level). 
For each second level reply, look through the next 3 third level replies. 

3. Figure out how to get the first paragraph of the wiki link, and then reply to the comment

*4. Figure out how to keep the bot running forever without having to turn on our computer
